# Abstract Design Methodologies: Non-Euclidean and Extrinsic Design

This is a repository made to hold the build of the prototype prepared for my Bachelor's Thesis on Abstract Design Methodologies: Non-Euclidean and Extrinsic Design, at CiTM, UPC, for the Videogame Design and Development Degree.

The prototype is a simple and short experience which is designed around and showcases cases of both Non-Euclidean and Extrinsic Design, and is prepared to evaluate how said mechanics are received by both experienced players as well as new ones.
