# Abstract Design Methodologies: Non-Euclidean and Extrinsic Design

This is a repository made to hold the build of the prototype prepared for my Bachelor's Thesis on Abstract Design Methodologies: Non-Euclidean and Extrinsic Design, at CiTM, UPC, for the Videogame Design and Development Degree.

PresÃ³ is a simple and short experience which is designed around and showcases cases of both Non-Euclidean and Extrinsic Design, and is prepared to evaluate how said mechanics are received by both experienced players as well as new ones.

### Description

Try to figure out how to get out of this misterious place you have reached while discovering the backstory behind it.

### Controls

* W key to move forward
* S Key to move backwards
* D Key to move right
* A Key to Move left
* Mouse to move your viewpoint around

> Anything else you might need will be told to you by the game.

### Known issues

#### Ingame

* If the keyboard prompt is triggered any subsequent click will trigger it again. It doesn't afect anything since you can't use it until you figure out what goes in it, simply press ESC to close it.

* Sometimes portals will print blue planes when looked at from very sharp angles. 

#### Files

* The release folders contain an encrypted ZIP which might cause trouble if you are using an external antivirus (it is not malicios, do not worry).
